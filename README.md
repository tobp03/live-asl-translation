# âœŠ Real-time Sign Language Translation with Citizen ASL Dataset ðŸ¤š

This project implements a full pipeline to translate sign language into text using pose estimation, deep learning, and a large language model (LLM) for sentence refinment. The live translation system is built using the [Citizen ASL Dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/asl-citizen/) and runs in real time with a webcam.

Watch a real-time demo of sign language translation using our trained model and the Citizen ASL dataset.
> Disclaimer: I am an amateur signer, and the signing in this demo may not fully follow formal ASL grammar or conventions.

## Features
