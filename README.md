# ✊ Real-time Sign Language Translation with Citizen ASL Dataset 

This project implements a full pipeline to translate sign language into text using pose estimation, deep learning, and a large language model (LLM) for sentence refinement. The live translation system is built using the [Citizen ASL Dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/asl-citizen/) and runs in real time with a webcam.

Watch a real-time demo of sign language translation using our trained model and the Citizen ASL dataset.
> Disclaimer: Not a professional signer, the signing in this demo may not fully follow formal ASL grammar.

## Features
- Pose-based sign language recognition using MediaPipe Holistic
- Normalization and preprocessing of landmark sequences
- GRU-based model trained on 200 unique glosses (271 total classes including duplicates) (approx. 80% accuracy on validation)
- Real-time webcam-based translation with LLM for sentence refinement (OpenAI GPT)


## Setup

### Requirements
Make sure to have Python 3.10.17 installed. You can use pyenv or another version manager to install and activate it.

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tobp03/live-asl-translation.git
cd live-asl-translation
```
### Install Dependencies
Once your done, in the correct environment:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Obtain API Key for LLM
This project uses [OpenAI GPT API](https://platform.openai.com) for sentence refinement during live translation. You need a valid API key with billing enabled. Crete a file named `.env` in the project root and add the following line:
```bash
API_KEY="sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

## 🚀 Usage
- Full pipeline
   To train your own model and reproduce the full workflow : Open and run `main_livefeed.ipynb`. This notebook contains all steps from start to finish:
   1.  Download the [Citizen ASL Dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/asl-citizen/)
   2.  Place the dataset folder in the same directory as `main_livefeed.ipynb` (the project root)
   3.  Open and run the full pipeline step 1-3 on `main_livefeed.ipynb`
   4.  Finally, use the trained model for live translation
- Direct use with Pre-trained model
  If you prefer to skip training
  1. Ensure the pre-trained GRU model (`.keras`) is available in the `/models` folder (already provided)
  2. Open `main_livefeed.ipynb`
  3. Jump directly to **Step 4** to start live translation using the pre-trained model
- Preprocessed data and model training is also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tobypu/aslcitizen-top200-training).
